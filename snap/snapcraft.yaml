summary: diagnose issues with power consumption and management
description: |
 PowerTOP is a Linux tool to diagnose issues with power consumption and
 power management. In addition to being a diagnostic tool, PowerTOP also
 has an interactive mode you can use to experiment with various power
 management settings, for cases where the Linux distribution has not
 enabled those settings.
 .
 PowerTOP reports which components in the system are most likely to blame
 for higher-than-needed power consumption, ranging from software
 applications to active components in the system. Detailed screens are
 available for CPU C and P states, device activity, and software activity.
